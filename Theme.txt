Orange Theming Overview
We’ve applied a consistent orange theme throughout the UI, ensuring the design feels cohesive, modern, and visually appealing. Here's the detailed breakdown of the theming applied across various components:

1. Color Palette:
Primary Color: Orange (#ff6600) – This is the core color, used for elements like buttons, links, and hover effects.

Secondary Color: Dark shades of text (#333) – This is the base color for most text elements, providing contrast and readability.

Background Color: White (#ffffff) – For the background of most elements, creating a clean, minimalist appearance.

Hover Effects: Orange – For any links and buttons that require hover interactions, the color #ff6600 is applied for consistency.

Text Highlighting: Red (for error messages or alerts, e.g., text-danger).

2. Typography:
Font for Logo:

Font Family: Lobster, cursive – This is a playful and food-related font, making it perfect for your "Menu Management" branding.

Font Weight: Bold for better emphasis on the logo text.

Color: Orange (#ff6600) for the logo text to align with the theme.

Font for Links and Buttons:

Font Weight: Medium/Bold – Provides emphasis and structure.

Text Color: Default #333 (dark gray) for text, with hover states changing to #ff6600 (orange) to create a visual connection to the theme.

3. Components and Their Styling:
Buttons:

Background: #ff6600 (Orange) for prominent action buttons like login, register, or dashboard.

Text: White – Ensures contrast and readability on the orange background.

Hover State: Buttons maintain their background color but can transition to darker shades of orange or change to #ff6600 when hovered.

Navbar:

Background: White (#ffffff), providing a clean backdrop.

Navbar Links: Default #333 (dark text) for clarity, changing to #ff6600 (orange) on hover for interactive elements.

Mobile Navbar Button: The button for the mobile navigation menu has an orange background (#ff6600) with white toggler icons.

Alerts:

Error Message: Red (via Bootstrap’s text-danger) to indicate something went wrong.

Success Message: Green (via Bootstrap’s alert-success) for positive feedback or confirmations.

4. Form Elements:
Input Fields:

Border Color: For some fields, the border-color changes to orange (#ff6600) on hover/focus, providing a nice interactive feel.

Placeholder: Consistent with the text color scheme, placeholder text uses a lighter gray shade for subtlety.

Forms:

Each form section (e.g., login, signup, password reset) maintains a white background with a rounded border and a shadow effect for depth.

Submit Buttons: Orange (#ff6600) for actions like submitting a form or sending a reset link.

5. Hover & Focus Effects:
Hover Effects: Links and buttons that change their color to orange (#ff6600) on hover create an engaging and interactive feel.

Smooth Transitions: On hover, most elements (buttons, links) smoothly transition between the default state and the hover state, ensuring a polished experience.

6. Consistency:
Every component is designed to follow this orange-centric theme. Whether it’s the logo, buttons, links, or form fields, orange (#ff6600) is used consistently to reinforce the brand identity.

We ensured that hover effects and button interactions match the overall look and feel of the UI.
